Linked List :
================

**--> It is the best choice if our frequent operation is insertion or deletion in middle because no shifting is allowed.
--> Internally linkedList class is doubly linked list data structure.
--> Rest features same as arrayList class : index value, maintain insertion order and allow duplicate and null.

--> internal representation of data is also different (Nodes and Address).

**--> Here, no capacity concept as ArrayList has 10(keeps on increasing), LinkedList will keep on adding and deleting the Nodes.


**--> LinkedList class also implement Deque Interface along with List.
