Vector Class :
===============

--> Vector List is similar to ArrayList but most of the methods are synchronized (thread safe)
--> If you need thread safety then only you should use Vector class.

Vector --> black and white TV
ArralList --> color TV --> Collections.synchronozedList(ArrayList) --> this will make ArrayList synchronized
so, avoid using vector.


Stack Class :
===============
--> Not recommended to use since it is child class of vector
--> Follow LIFO Principle
