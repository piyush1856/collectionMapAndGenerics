ArrayList(class) :
====================

Apart form inheriting the features and method of List, ArrayList has some addition benifits :

    - It is the implementation of List Interface
    - It dynamically increase/decrease in size
    - Duplicate allowed
    - null insertion allowed (multiple null)

    **ArrayList class is best choice if operation is retrieval based on index.
    **ArrayList IS-A List, Collection and Iterable


Auto-Boxing And Unboxing :
============================

In java we have total 8 primitive datatypes are there, and corresponding wrapper classes
--these wrapper classes belongs to java.lang package

int x =10; // primitive value
--before java 1.5, to add primitive to collection we need to wrap primitive to corresponding to wrapper class
Integer i1 = Integer.valueOf(x);
This concept is called boxing.

int x = i1.intValue();
This is called unboxing. Getting primitive from wrapper class object


--* From java 1.8 onward we have auto-boxing and auto-unboxing.
int i = 10;
Integer i1 = i; //auto-boxing
int x = i1 // auto-unboxing
Automatically taken care by compiler.
