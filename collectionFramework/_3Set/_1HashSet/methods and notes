HashSet :
=============

--> it is implementation of Set
--> It internally uses hashing technique to store the value
--> it is the best choice if our frequent operation is Searching -> O(1)
--> Hashing uses O(1) time complexity

-> duplicate not allowed
-> Only one null insertion is allowed
-> It doesn't preserve the sequence


HashSet hs = new HashSet();
-> default capacity is 16
-> load factor -> 0.75 -> after completion of 75% of hasgSet a new HashSet will be created
->   HashSet<Integer> hs = new HashSet<>(1200,0.8f);  --> not recommended to give load factor and capacity


NOTE: All the collection classes are mutually inclusive, i.e, we can convert any any collection class to another collection class




LinkedHashSet :
==================
**--> To preserve the insertion sequence use LinkedHash Set
    -> It is child of HashSet.
