TreeSet :
==========
-> all property of HashSet
-> default order -> ascending
-> underlying data structure is balanced tree.
-> duplicate not allowed
-> insertion order will not be preserved
-> no index support
-> element will be in sorted order
-> even single 'null' not allowed -> null pointer exception


comparable :
==============
-> within a class
If we try to add any element in TReeSet must implement comparable interface,
otherwise it throws class cast exception

All the wrapper classes and String class internally implement Comparable interface.

-> This comparable interface belong to java.lang package
    This interface has only one method : public int compareTo(obj);
    By the help of this method we need to define sorting logic inside Student class or any class which we want to add in tree set

-> NOTE :  HashSet and LinkedHash set class verify uniqueness of an object using equals and hashCode method,
            whereas TreeSet class verify the uniqueness of an obj by using compareTo()


Comaparator Interface :
=======================
this inerface belong to java.util package
-> define a sorting logic outside the class
-> this interface also having one abstract method
    public int compare(Object o1, Object o2);

->  NOTE : using comparable we can define only one sorting logic within a class,
            but, using comparator we define multiple sorting ligoc for a class outside a class
