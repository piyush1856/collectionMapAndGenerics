Queue :
=========
-> if you want to represent a group od object before processing then we shouls use queue :
    eg : sending email/sms to multiple people

-> FIFO order by default but we can change or implement our own method  by using priority queue class
-> java 1.5 version
=> null insertion not allowed
-> element inside queue should be Comparable or we can use Comparator


NOTE : Inside the queue, the element will not be as sorted as inside the TreeSet, but by using its peek and poll method or remove method,
       It will work according to comparable or comparator.

DEQUE:
=======
-> Double ended queue
